## Code editor or IDE

Ultimately, it's your choice. VSCode is recommended.

### Visual Studio Code

- free & open source code editor by Microsoft (**!=** Visual Studio IDE)
- wide extension support
- lightweight, multiplatform support
- good [docs & instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics)
- choice of many JS developers, supports multiple JS frameworks/libraries

#### Install Extensions

Press _ctrl-shift-x_ or click extensions icon on the left panel.

Search and install:

- Prettier: Code formatter
- EditorConfig for VS Code
- Auto Import
- ESLint
- JavaScript (ES6) Code Snippets

#### VSCode - Basic Usage

Active **project** is the folder open on the left side panel (_File -> Open folder..._)

Handy keyboard shortcuts (finnish layout, check _File -> Preferences -> Keyboard shortcuts_ for more)

- [Command palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/tips-and-tricks#_command-palette): _ctrl-shift-p_ | ⇧⌘P
- Multiline comment: _ctrl-'_
- Delete line: _ctrl-shift-k_
- Move line(s): _alt-up/down_

#### VSCode - Settings

(Windows users only) Change integrated console to Bash in Windows:

1. Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to default location
2. Edit vscode settings file (_File -> Preferences -> Settings_) and search for 'terminal'.
3. Change 'Terminal › External: Windows Exec' value to "C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe"

### WebStorm/PhpStorm

- free for Metropolia students. [Apply for license here](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/)
  - _@metropolia.fi_ email address needed for a free license
- full featured IDE
- quite ready out of the box. No need for plugins.
- based on IntelliJ IDEA, just like Android Studio

- Other IDEs like: IntelliJ Ultimate IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans, etc. will do too

---

## Browser & debugging

- Chrome & [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/)

---

## Source Code Management - Git

What files to include in repo?

- all source code
- README.md and other documentation
- npm, .editorconfig, linter, etc. project specific config files
- .gitignore file: list of local stuff not to be included in the version control

Exclude:

- IDE specific project files & folders (.idea)
- build targets and other automatically generated files
- packages managed e.g. by npm or bower (= _node_modules/_ & _bower_components/_ folders)
- any temp & OS specific files, like Apple's `.DS_Store`

---

## Package Management

### [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) - Node.js Package Manager

- Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to get the package manager **npm**
- npm packages needed in a project (dependencies) are listed in the `package.json` file and can be install with `npm install` command
- locally installed (=project specific) packages are downloaded to `node_modules/` folder (should be excluded from version control)

---

## Building & automating tasks

### [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

>At its core, webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications.

- module support
- local dev server
- live reload
- file loaders
- wide plugin support
- creates different bundles for local development and production deployment

Other similar tools:

- [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) task runner
- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) automation tool
